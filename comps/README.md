## tailwind

when installing tailwind, make sure to use the right document! The document ALWAYS changes for the setup. Make sure you use the latest from the site. At current, I'm using v3.2.4
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app

Ctrl + k - will open up the search modal in the tailwind site

## prop-types

per Stephen Grider - not as popular anymore

## classnames

JS Library for building up a 'className' string based on different values
Library is called 'classnames', but prop is 'className'
EXCELLENT in creating css strings for example a custom button

## react-icon

Another EXCELLENT library to use for Icons
