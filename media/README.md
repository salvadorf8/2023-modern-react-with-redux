we are going to assume the user is on a bandwidth constrained connection
the data-loading experience must be near-perfect
we are going to look at data fetching with plain RTK, then use RTK Query

DATA FETCHING we will do is
Lazy Fetching: BEST APPROACH - 1st) first call give me list of users - 2nd) click on user - another call give me list of albums for that user - 3rd) click on album - another call give me list of photos for that album

we will use spinners
